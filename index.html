            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
     I am a student of the UNC coding bootcamp with some background experience in both front end and back end languages. I am eager to sharpen my skills and continue my learning so I can become a successful developer.  My past experience working with front end and back end languages comes from a coding certification I aquired while working towards a Bachelor's degree in computer science. I found that I thoroughly enjoyed learning how to code despite how challenging it can be at times.  I look forward to continuing my education in order to pursue my goal of becoming a full stack developer.
