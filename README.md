# PortfolioHomework
an about me portfolio
This portfolio will include three pages- an about me page, a portfolio page, and a contact page.
The about me page includes a profile picture of myself as well as a few paragraphs about me.
The portfolio page will include links to my recent projects.  These links are in the form of images.
The contact page will include a form that requests the users name, email, and message.
The intent of this portfolio is to provide potential employers access to projects and repositories, an easy way to contect me, and information about me as a person.
