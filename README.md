an about me portfolio

This portfolio will include three pages- an about me page, a portfolio page, and a contact page.


The about me page includes a profile picture of myself as well as a few paragraphs about myself.  I added three paragraphs- one that explains
how and why I got into coding as well as what my goals are, one that explains my current employment, and one that talks about my hobbies and interests.


The portfolio page will include links to my recent projects.  These links will be in the form of images. Until I have projects to link, I will use a "Coming Soon"
image as a placeholder image. Once I have completed a project, I will link it to the appropriate table cell and replace the coming soon image with a screenshot
of the project.  I will use a placeholder as a link until I have a project to connect it to.

The contact page will include a form that requests the users name, email, and message. 


The intent of this portfolio is to provide potential employers access to projects and repositories, an easy way to contect me, and information about me as a person.
The background image used on my pages in my portfolio was downloaded from https://subtlepatterns.com/
